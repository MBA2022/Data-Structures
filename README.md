## Introduction

This repository includes implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. Each data structure is implemented in its own Java class with relevant methods and functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the data structures in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MBA2022/Data-Structures.git
    cd Data-Structures
    ```

2. **Compile the Java Files:**
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```

3. **Run the Examples:**
    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```
